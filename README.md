# reboot-assessment

I use Anaconda Spyder Python version 3.8.
I managed to extract and save the names of the top 20 cities of UK and the corresponding URL for restaurants.
I turn URLs into HTMLs by using a library package requests. And then by BeautifulSoup package I extract the contents of the desired HTMLs such as the names ,restaurants etc. 
Applying the filter of vegan friendly options the URL was not different so I could not follow the same process.
Trying to inspect where to find the data for vegan friendly restaurants, I found the class '_1D_QUaKi ' of span that inludes the number of vegan friendly restaurants per capita but I did not make it to extract it automatically like the above data.
In comments some attemps can be seen.
In order to complete the task of visualizing the data I created a list and saved manually the number of vegan friendly restaurants per capita according to the list of names.
I understand that this is not an accepted way to extract data however I really wanted to complete the task anyhow.
